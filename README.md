## üì¶ Project Structure

The backend provides endpoints to register software engineers and their tech stacks. It includes a special endpoint that sends a prompt to an AI service, which generates a concise analysis of the engineer‚Äôs skills.

### Key Features:
- RESTful API for managing engineers and skills.
- Dockerized PostgreSQL database and Spring Boot application.
- AI-based skill analysis using a language model.
- Fully deployed and tested in an EC2 instance with public access.
